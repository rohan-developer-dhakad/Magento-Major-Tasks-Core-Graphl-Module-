Custom Payment & Delivery Method


Create a GraphQL to update the above mentioned fields and retrieve the data from Customer, Products, Order

Custom Payment method and delivery method should be configured from backend for particular location. Ex: If i configure bangalore it should show only for shipping address bangalore

All the above should be created as an extension. If I install the extension it should work. Need instructions as well for configuration.
